# Java-Snake-Game
"Snake Game" aims to eat as many apples as possible to achieve the highest score and enjoy the challenge of this fun version of the traditional snake game. I built it to practice JavaFX to explore various aspects of game development, like graphics rendering, collision detection, and scoring systems.
